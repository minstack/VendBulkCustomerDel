# VendBulkCustomerDel

To make bulk customer deletes more efficient without the need for the use of (multiple) CSVs, VLOOKUPs and text formatting to manually copy paste to backend.


# Platform
Currently macOS only, however, the Windows binary can be compiled easily if needed.


# Setup
Download the VendBulkCustomerDel.app file and double click to run.


# Steps
    1. Run app
    2. Input the store prefix and copy/paste token (expiry set)
    3. Add as many CSVs provided by the retailer (since customer export will split into 1000 lines per CSV)
    4. Complete (select) checklist items
    5. Press Delete Customers to run
